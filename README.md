An onboarding procedure for my work machine.

What does this give you?
- A nice powershell terminal that shows you information about your current repo (branch and changes made).
- macOS Style spotlight search and keyboard shortcuts (shortcuts must be manually set).
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) style git aliases.
- Ability to install any Windows app using the terminal (with choco or scoop).
